        "\n",
        "**Isolation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Since processes are isolated from each other, if one crashes, it doesn’t affect others. This is beneficial for applications that require fault tolerance and stability.\n",

        "**Avoiding GIL Limitations:**\n",
        "\n",

        "A process pool is a collection of pre-instantiated processes that are used to execute tasks concurrently. It is designed to manage multiple processes efficiently by reusing a limited number of worker processes to perform tasks, instead of creating and destroying processes repeatedly. This approach reduces the overhead associated with process creation and destruction, making it more efficient for executing many small or similar tasks.\n",

        "**Task Queueing:**\n",
        "When tasks are submitted to the pool, they are added to a queue. The worker processes in the pool take tasks from this queue as they become available, allowing for a controlled distribution of work.\n",

In contrast to multithreading, where multiple threads share the same memory space, multiprocessing creates separate memory spaces for each process.
